# Spring-2016-Flight-Code
Code used in our High Altitude Balloon Payload

This code was compiled from example sketches on Adafruit.com (where we ordered all of our sensors and components from),
and from tutorials by Jeremy Blum (jeremyblum.com) and Paul Mcwhorter (toptechboy.com).

This code is for use with an Arduino Mega, and some changes would need to be made in order to be usable with an Arduino Uno or other model. Adafruit.com has tutorials and forums addressing these changes and differences.

 more comments/instructions/explanations will be coming!!!
